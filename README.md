# SharedIndividualDifferences

This project contains the following files:

1) SID_rawData.csv: Includes data from all individuals, including the ones that were excluded from the final analyses and contains untransformed variables. 

2) SID_cdataCeaning.Rmd: This is the script that we used to clean the raw data. The output of this script is the data frame that we used in main analyses. 

3) SID_selfRatings: If you would like to use our data to perform new analyses, we recommend that you use this file. We performed all our analyses on this cleaned data frame. 

4) SID_mainAnalysis.Rmd: This is the main analysis script.
   
5) rmse.neigh.mean.csv, rmse.other.mean.csv, opt_cohort_size.csv, min_point_mean.csv: These four files are outputs of the mainAnalysis script. Running this analysis can take a while, so we are providing the output.
